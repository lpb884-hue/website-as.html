    <div>Internet as Food</div>

<div>
  <span>The internet is a buffet.</span> At its core, the internet feeds us. We arrive hungry — hungry for knowledge, distraction, validation, entertainment. We scroll through endless platters of content, sampling bites until something satisfies our craving. Some days we snack. Other days we binge.
</div>

<div>
  <span>Users are diners.</span> We sit at glowing tables, menus curated by algorithms that learn our tastes. We accept cookies without reading the recipe, leaving crumbs of data behind with every click. Our feeds are personalized dishes, seasoned to our preferences. Some people order the same comfort meal every day. Others chase bold, unfamiliar flavors across new platforms.
</div>

<div>
  <span>The web is both pantry and marketplace.</span> For those with access, it’s always open — a 24/7 drive-thru of information. For others, it’s harder to reach the table. Behind the scenes, massive servers act like industrial kitchens, constantly cooking up new content, storing ingredients, preserving leftovers. We rarely see the full supply chain. We only taste what’s plated in front of us.
</div>

<div>
  <span>The tunnels connect like kitchen corridors.</span> What feels like a single website is really a doorway into a sprawling food court. Links are passageways between restaurants. Platforms are different cuisines. One click can move us from a small neighborhood café to a global franchise. It’s easy to forget how vast the kitchen really is.
