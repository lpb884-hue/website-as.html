  <h1 class="title">Internet as Food</h1>

  <main class="content">

    <p class="layer bun-top">
      The internet is a buffet. At its core, the internet feeds us. We arrive hungry — hungry for knowledge, distraction, validation, entertainment. We scroll through endless platters of content, sampling bites until something satisfies our craving. Some days we snack. Other days we binge.
