    <div>Internet as Food</div>
    <div><span>The internet is yummy.</span> At its core, the internet feeds. People are hungy. Hungry for knowledge, entertainment, a break from real life.</div>
    <div><span>Users are consumers.</span> You could imagine that all users are restaurant patrons, sitting down and ordering a meal. We tend to sift the web looking for media that satifies our hunger. There's a feeling of community in that. Similar tastes, similar orders. Some people stick with what they know. Others branch out for new tastes.</div>
    <div><span>The internet is always availiable for people who have access, and more difficult to come by for people who dont.</span> Much like food, we are always building new parts of the web. It's hard to understand or visualize the whole network, our perspecitve is more about individual tunnels, channels that we follow with others. It's opaque.</div>
    <div><span>The tunnels connect.</span> What may seem like a single entry point from above ground is a portal to a vast network.</div>
